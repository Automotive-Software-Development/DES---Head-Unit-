# DES Project - Head Unit
This project aims to develop a Head Unit Qt application running on a Raspberry Pi (RPi) alongside the previously developed PiRacer Instrument Cluster Qt application. The Head Unit application will provide additional features like ambient lighting, gear selection, and a media app.

## Goals and Objectives

1. Develop a robust and scalable head unit application for automotive use on Raspberry Pi
2. Integrate the application with the instrument cluster app and other vehicle systems through IPC (Inter-Process Communication) and CAN (Controller Area Network)
3. Implement ambient lighting control through the Head Unit application
4. Display of the current gear selection on the Head Unit GUI
5. Develop a media app, including functionality for playing and controlling music and videos
